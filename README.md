This is a repo to share the work Giacomo and Baptiste are doing in relation to create a SaaS version of integration.Qlik.com


## What's the value?

### Introduction to Web Integration
Unlike other Business Intelligence and Analytics Platforms on the market that start out as BI platforms and become endpoints within a data project, Qlik wants to ensure that what
is created inside the *Qlik Active Intelligence Platform*, does not remain bounded and accessible only within it but can be embedded
in a single platform entry-point which corporate decision-making processes take place.

Hence, if we create a data model together with data visualization layer in Qlik, this by default will be accessible on the dedicated Qlik Sense SaaS tenant but can also be embedded within portals, business solutions or services that an ISV delivers to its end customers.

This can be easily accomplished because Qlik embedded strategy is not based on proprietary languages, but on standard web technologies. This is enriched by what we call at  Qlik *"API first approach"* which allows us to expose almost all the features of the standard product to be integrated and used within A third party applications.

### What is a mashup and what are common use cases?
