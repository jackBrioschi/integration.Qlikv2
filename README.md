## How to move your mashup from Qlik Sense Client-Managed to Qlik Cloud?

### Assess your current web integration
Typically the three main pillars for completing an integration project concern understanding and choosing *where to host the solution*,  *how I can authenticate and authorize users* who already use the services inside my platform to be able to access the embedded analytics and which is the *web integration method* most in line with the needs you have.
There are many different ways and possibility to deploy mashup with Qlik. Start by asking you the right questions:

 * *Where my mashup or web application is hosted?*

 * *How do I manage the authentication?*

 * *Which embedding strategy do I currently use?*

### Authentication
Within this part, therefore, we must deal with the concept of security within the Sense platform and show you also in this case the different possibilities we have to authenticate a user to our platform. Authentication in Qlik Sense allows you to establish a user session within the platform and typically answers the question *"Who is the user"*? The authentication process requires that based on something that the user has, this allows him or her to access the platform or not. 
In Qlik Sense Cloud, as well as in Qlik Sense Client-Managed, you can use an already existing identity provider (IdP) when setting up your deployment.
